C# unit test application

This application made with C # shows the main codes of 3 different algorithms (digkstra, bellman-ford, kruskal) and 3 different unit test cases that allow us to try them.

Our application consists of 2 different projects as class library and class library test. Class library is opened with dll. 
It searches whether the inputs and outputs are equal or not.
